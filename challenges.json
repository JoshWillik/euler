For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.\n\nA modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.\n\nFor unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both &#34;halves&#34;, it is impossible to decrypt the message.\n\nUnfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.\n\nYour task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using \n\ncipher.txt\n\n (right click and &#39;Save Link/Target As...&#39;), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.",

Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\n\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.\n\nCommunity Chest (2/16 cards):\n\nAdvance to GO\n\nGo to JAIL\n\nChance (10/16 cards):\n\nAdvance to GO\n\nGo to JAIL\n\nGo to C1\n\nGo to E3\n\nGo to H2\n\nGo to R1\n\nGo to next R (railway company)\n\nGo to next R\n\nGo to next U (utility company)\n\nGo back 3 squares.\n\nThe heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between &#34;Just Visiting&#34; and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to &#34;get out of jail&#34;, assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.\n\nBy starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.\n\nStatistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.\n\nIf, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.",

Number &#34;\n\n8\n\n&#34; lights them all.\n\nThe clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.\n\nTo turn on a &#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34; will cost 5 transitions, while a &#34;\n\n7\n\n&#34; will cost only 4 transitions.\n\nSam and Max built two different clocks.\n\nSam&#39;s clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows &#34;\n\n137\n\n&#34;, then the panel is turned off, then the next number (&#34;\n\n11\n\n&#34;) is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (&#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34;) is turned on and, after some time, off.\n\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam&#39;s clock requires:\n\n&#34;\n\n137\n\n&#34;\n\n:\n\n(2 + 5 + 4) \u00d7 2 = 22 transitions (&#34;\n\n137\n\n&#34; on/off).\n\n&#34;\n\n11\n\n&#34;\n\n:\n\n(2 + 2) \u00d7 2 = 8 transitions (&#34;\n\n11\n\n&#34; on/off).\n\n&#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34;\n\n:\n\n(5) \u00d7 2 = 10 transitions (&#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34; on/off).\n\nFor a grand total of 40 transitions.\n\nMax&#39;s clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won&#39;t be needed for the next number.\n\nFor number 137, Max&#39;s clock requires:\n\n&#34;\n\n137\n\n&#34;\n\n:\n\n2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (&#34;\n\n137\n\n&#34; on)\n\n7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number &#34;\n\n11\n\n&#34;).\n\n&#34;\n\n11\n\n&#34;\n\n:\n\n0 transitions (number &#34;\n\n11\n\n&#34; is already turned on correctly)\n\n3 transitions (to turn off the first &#34;\n\n1\n\n&#34; and the bottom part of the second &#34;\n\n1\n\n&#34;; \n\nthe top part is common with number &#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34;).\n\n&#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34;\n\n:\n\n4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a &#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34;)\n\n5 transitions (to turn off number &#34;\n\n2\n\n&#34;).\n\nFor a grand total of 30 transitions.\n\nOf course, Max&#39;s clock consumes less power than Sam&#39;s one.\n\nThe two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10\n\n7\n\n and B = 2\u00d710\n\n7\n\n. \n\nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam&#39;s clock and that needed by Max&#39;s one.",

        "description": "Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect 2% of the sheep population.\n\nAn accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.\n\nBecause of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:\n\nThe sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. \n\nFor each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,\n\nIf the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.\n\nIf the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\n\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\n\nNegative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98\n\n5\n\n = 0.9039207968.\n\nPositive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\n\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 \u00d7 5 = 1.480396016.\n\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 \u00d7 5 = \n\n7.40198008\n\n tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\n\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\n\nWe may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.\n\nIf we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).\n\nWe can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.\n\nTo simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\n\nFor the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we&#39;ll call it the \n\noptimal strategy\n\n) requires an average of just \n\n4.155452\n\n tests!\n\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T(\n\ns\n\n,\n\np\n\n) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of \n\ns\n\n sheep for a virus having probability \n\np\n\n to be present in any individual.\n\nThus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\n\nFind \u03a3T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.\n\nGive your answer rounded to six decimal places.",

Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\n\nQuick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m\n\n3\n\n. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.\n\nWe shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \\approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \\approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.\n\nFred&#39;s eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin&#39;s drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it&#39;s the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.\n\nIf Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer&#39;s appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places.",

The value of \n\nv\n\n depends on \n\ny\n\n0\n\n and \n\ny\n\n1\n\n as follows:\n\n If \n\ny\n\n0\n\n = \n\ny\n\n1\n\n, the value of \n\nv\n\n equals \n\ny\n\n0\n\n.\n\n If \n\ny\n\n0\n\n \u2260 \n\ny\n\n1\n\n, the value of \n\nv\n\n equals (\n\ny\n\n1\n\n - \n\ny\n\n0\n\n) / (ln(\n\ny\n\n1\n\n) - ln(\n\ny\n\n0\n\n)).\n\nThe left image is one of the possible paths for \n\nd\n\n = 4. First the ant goes from A(0, 1) to P\n\n1\n\n(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) \u2248 1.8205. Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 \u2248 1.2283.\n\nFrom P\n\n1\n\n(1, 3) to P\n\n2\n\n(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2 / 3 \u2248 0.6667. From P\n\n2\n\n(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) \u2248 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 \u2248 1.2283.\n\nThus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.\n\nThe right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as 0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for \n\nd\n\n = 4.\n\nLet F(\n\nd\n\n) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path.

For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a05) contains 20% \n\nA\n\n, 30% \n\nB\n\n and 50% \n\nC\n\n.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.\n\nFor example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a02), (3\u00a0:\u00a06\u00a0:\u00a011) and (3\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a04).

Let S(\n\nk\n\n) represent chef #\n\nk\n\n&#39;s skill level (which is publicly known).

On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob&#39;s inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.\n\nThe following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for \n\nn\n\n = 3, \n\nk\n\n = 7, \n\na\n\n = 2, \n\nb\n\n = 4, and \n\nc\n\n = 6:\n\nLet E(\n\nn\n\n,\n\nk\n\n,\n\na\n\n,\n\nb\n\n,\n\nc\n\n) be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.\n\nInterestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example, E(2,5,1,3,5) = 60 and E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358.\n\nFind the last nine digits of \u2211\n\n1\u2264\n\nn\n\n\u226410000\n\n E(\n\nn\n\n,10\n\nn\n\n,3\n\nn\n\n,6\n\nn\n\n,9\n\nn\n\n).",

        "description": "Despite the popularity of Hilbert&#39;s infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.\n\nTo cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\n\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert&#39;s freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\n\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can \n\nreceive\n\n power from many other floors at once, it can only \n\nsend\n\n power to one other floor.\n\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.\n\nLet F(\n\nn\n\n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of \n\nn\n\n floors. For example, F(3) = 6, F(8) = 16276736, and F(100) mod 135707531 = 84326147.\n\nFind F(12344321) mod 135707531.",

After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either \n\ng\n\n &lt; \n\nt\n\n, \n\ng\n\n = \n\nt\n\n, or \n\ng\n\n &gt; \n\nt\n\n. Then the process can repeat as necessary.\n\nNormally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound \n\nL\n\n and upper bound \n\nH\n\n (initialized to \n\nL\n\n = 1 and \n\nH\n\n = \n\nn\n\n), let \n\ng\n\n = \u230a(\n\nL\n\n+\n\nH\n\n)/2\u230b where \u230a\u22c5\u230b is the integer floor function.

After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once \n\nt\n\n is found. Even if \n\nt\n\n can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.\n\nYour friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting \n\ng\n\n = \u230a(\n\nL\n\n+\n\nH\n\n)/2\u230b, simply let \n\ng\n\n be a random integer between \n\nL\n\n and \n\nH\n\n, inclusive.

Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.\n\nNow Bob places \n\nn\n\n bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a small circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet at one point on the ball.\n\nUsing three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length 2.84, resulting in a total length of 8.52 for all three bots, each time rounded to two decimal places.
